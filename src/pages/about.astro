      <strong>What is a holistic software engineer?</strong> I focus on the entire
      software development lifecycle, from understanding user needs and designing
      intuitive interfaces to writing clean, efficient code and ensuring smooth deployment
      and maintenance. I believe that great software is built not just through coding,
      but through a deep understanding of the problem space and a commitment to delivering
      value to users.

      It was my shot to fame! I was part of a Guiness World Record for taking part in the world's largest Game Jam held at the University of Bedfordshire. 
      While everyone else were rehashing a set of supplied game assets and boilerplate code, I decided to go all out and build a game from scratch, using WPF and C#. Mainly because my friend was more familiar with it than C++. 
      The game had to be based on London and the game that I developed was mishmash of Ghostbusters, Crazy Taxi and Chuchu Rocket called "London Cabbie"
